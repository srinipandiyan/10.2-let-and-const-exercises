# ****let* and *const* Exercise**

In this exercise, you’ll refactor some ES5 code into ES2015.

## ****ES5 Global Constants****

var PI = 3.14;
PI = 42; // stop me from doing this!

## ****ES2015 Global Constants****
const PI = 3.14;
PI = 42; //cannot reassign const PI in global scope

*## **Quiz**

- What is the difference between ***var*** and ***let***?
    Var is a function-scope declaration operator while let is within block-scope.
    Var can be redeclared while let cannot.
    Declarations made using var are hoisted.
- What is the difference between ***var*** and ***const***?
    Var is a function-scope declaration operator while const is within block-scope.
    Var can be redeclared and reassigned while const cannot.
    Declarations made using var are hoisted.
- What is the difference between ***let*** and ***const***?
    Let allows for reassignment while const does not.
- What is hoisting?
    Hoisting is the altering of the flow of exection by pushing to the top of the execution stack hoisted elements such as variables before they are initialized.
